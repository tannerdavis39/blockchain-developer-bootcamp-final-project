# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project
(Disclaimer: The general idea of my project was created before I learned of Filecoin and NFT's. I understand now that these are better alternatives for this kind of decentralized application.)


Develop a blockchain that the music industry could theoretically use to handle copyright issues.

An artist's private key could verify if a particular artist had a recording logged to the chain, and if someone created a song that was too similair to that recording, then the timestamp could be used to testify that the original was created first.

Requirements:
 1. The user should be able to add proof of their song the contract.
 2. The user should be able to continually verify that they are the owner of the song.
