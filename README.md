# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project
(Disclaimer: The general idea of my project was formed before I learned of Filecoin and NFT's. I understand now that these are better alternatives for this kind of decentralized application.)


# Develop a blockchain that the music industry could use to handle copyright issues.

Using my dapp, an artist will use a SHA-256 hash of their audio file to log, and later verify that they are the owner of the original file that stores their song. The SongID is a way of establishing a time table for when songs were created. For example, a song with the ID of 42 would've been created before 187. This allows a method of proving copyright status.


Requirements:
 1. The user should be able to add proof of their song the contract.
 2. The user should be able to continually verify that they are the owner of the song.
