# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

My idea is to create a blockchain for the music industry to replace the system of copyrighting. An artist's private key would verify if a particular artist had a recording logged to the chain, and if someone created a song that was too similair to that recording, then the "timestamp" could be used to testiy that the original was created first.
